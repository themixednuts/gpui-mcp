# gpui-mcp

Give MCP agents eyes and hands inside a
[GPUI](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/tree/main/crates/gpui) app.

Agents can inspect the live UI, click, type, focus, hover, drag, scroll, take
screenshots, and record video. It works on Windows 11, macOS, and Linux X11.

## Setup

Install the MCP server:

```console
cargo install --git https://github.com/themixednuts/gpui-mcp --locked gpui-mcp-server
```

Add it to your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gpui": {
      "command": "gpui-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Add the bridge and its GPUI build to your app:

```toml
[dependencies]
gpui = "=0.2.2"
gpui-mcp = { git = "https://github.com/themixednuts/gpui-mcp", branch = "main" }

[patch.crates-io]
gpui = { git = "https://github.com/themixednuts/gpui-mcp", branch = "main" }
```

Install the bridge when you create a window and keep the returned handle in
your root view:

```rust,ignore
use gpui_mcp::{AppId, BridgeConfig, BridgeHandle};

let app_id = AppId::new("my-app")?;
let bridge = BridgeHandle::install(
    window,
    cx,
    BridgeConfig::new(app_id, "My App"),
)?;
```

That is the whole integration. The MCP client discovers running apps
automatically.

## Building your UI

Write ordinary GPUI elements with stable IDs and normal event handlers:

```rust,ignore
div()
    .id("save")
    .on_click(cx.listener(|this, _, _, cx| this.save(cx)))
    .child("Save")
```

`gpui-mcp` discovers the rendered hierarchy, text, bounds, state, and available
interactions automatically. Use `SemanticElementExt` only when a control's
meaning cannot be inferred, such as identifying a tab or naming an icon button.

See the [demo](examples/demo/src/main.rs) for a complete window. For live
HTML/CSS interfaces, see the [visual builder guide](docs/visual-builder.md).

Only enable automation in development, testing, or another explicitly trusted
environment. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
