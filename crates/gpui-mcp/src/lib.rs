//! Hardened, cross-platform MCP automation for GPUI applications.
//!
//! Install [`BridgeHandle`] for a window and retain it for that window's
//! lifetime. GPUI emits semantics automatically from stable element IDs,
//! registered interaction behavior, and optional semantic extension traits.
//! Control stays on owner-restricted native local IPC and authenticated
//! requests are dispatched through GPUI's foreground executor.
